### Hello!

I'm a person with many interests, some of which happen to be about coding and all that.

I'm planning to use Github to store and archive all my coding related projects (and possibly a bit more) (also motivate my brain to do things by seeing the squares turn green).

Currently working on a Bachelors engineering degree in IT. At my 3rd year and 5th semester as of now.

### Repo stats because they look coooool

The day some language pushes out Java %age to the second place will be a day I'll make sure to celebrate.
