### Hello!

I'm a person with many interests, some of which happen to be about coding and all that.

I'm planning to use GitHub to store and archive all my coding related projects (and possibly a bit more) (also motivate my brain to do things by seeing the squares turn green).

Currently working on a Bachelors engineering degree in IT. At my 3rd year and 5th semester as of now.

### Repo stats because they look coooool

**Most Used Languages** Java-free since `25/02/2023` thanks to __`Jupyter Notebook`__ and my __Machine Learning__ studies.

**Top Languages by Repo** still plagued by Java.

**Top Languages by Commit** still plagued by Java.

The day some language pushes out Java %age out of all of those to the fifth place will be a day I'll make sure to celebrate.
