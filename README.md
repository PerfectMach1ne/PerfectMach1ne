### Hello!

I'm a CS student with too many interests, many of them technical.

I'm planning to use Github to store and archive all my coding related projects (and possibly a bit more).

Currently working on a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. At my 2nd year and 4th semester as of now.

### My experience with programming languages (and a few more things)

Language | Months spent with it (approx.) | Skill strength | My plans
--- | --- | --- | ---
C | 25 months | Decent | Slowly reading "The C Programming Language" whenever I have time. I have as much love for it in my brain and heart as I do for C++.
C++ | 22 months | Decent | My first ever beloved language. Want to and **will** come back to it some day; I want to go through "Thinking in C++" from start to finish.
Java | 9 months | Kinda decent | Not my favourite language, but I'm willing to do some projects in it; uni made me use it for 3 classes.
SQL | 8 months | Kinda decent | Very not experienced but very *yest* interested; **VERY** willing to learn about anything backend related.
JS/HTML/CSS | 5 months (as of end of June 2022) | Weak | I'm a total newbie[^1] to frontend and I had to work with it for university. Willing to learn more.
Python | 4 months (as of end of June 2022) | Decent | Finished a paid university based course in it but I still need a lot of studying, practice and some reason to use it.
C# | 0.1 months | Coded a 'Hello World' | Interested in learning it in the future.
Assembly | n/a | Nothing | Very not experienced but very interested; VERY willing to learn about anything backend related.
Git and Github | - | Clueless | I just still get really confused with all this pull push and commit stuff.

### Non-coder skills/areas of interest

* **Mathematics** (I'm trying my best)
  * Calculus & analysis (one day I **will** understand it on satisfactory level, I believe it, I believe in me)
  * Statistics (winter semester 3 taught me to love it)
  * Graph theory (I always liked graphs, but summer semester 4 made me like them even more)
  * Combinatorics (super hard and tough to learn, but super fun and rewarding to comprehend and play with)
  * Topology (sometimes I daydream about being skilled enough in mathematics to be able to jump into this rabbithole)
* **Electronics** (learning stuff about it whenever I got time)
* Physics, chemistry, biology, astronomy... (I am interested but that's it really; most 10 year olds are better at all of those than me as of current)
* Drawing and writing, art in general (more personal and GitHub's *probably not* the place for those[^2].)
* Minecraft (I have a singleplayer survival world that I've kept alive since 26th September 2019[^3].)
