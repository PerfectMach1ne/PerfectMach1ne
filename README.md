### Hello!

I'm a CS student with too many interests, many of them technical.

I'm planning to use Github to store and archive all my coding related projects (and possibly a bit more).

Currently working on a Bachelors degree in Computer Science. At my 2nd year and 4th semester as of now.

### My experience with programming languages (and a few more things)

Language | Months spent with it (approx.) | Skill strength | My plans
--- | --- | --- | ---
C++ | 22 months | Decent | Want to and **will** come back to it some day; I want to go through "Thinking in C++" from start to finish.
C | 22 months | Decent | Slowly reading "The C Programming Language" whenever I have time.
Java | 9 months | Kinda decent | Not my favourite language, but I'm willing to do some projects in it; uni made me use it for 3 classes.
SQL | 8 months | Weakly decent | Very not experienced but very *yest* interested; **VERY** willing to learn about anything backend related.
JS/HTML/CSS | 4 months (as of end of June 2022) | Weak | I'm a total newbie to frontend and I had to work with it for university. Willing to learn more.
Python | 2 months | Weak | Finished a course in it but I still need a lot of studying & practice.
C# | 0.1 months | Coded a 'Hello World' | Interested in learning it in the future.
Assembly | n/a | Nothing | Very not experienced but very interested; VERY willing to learn about anything backend related.
